    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Jujutsu_Kaisen">Jujutsu Kaisen</a> series <br>
            He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. <br>
            Satoru is the pride of the <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Sorcerer_Family#Gojo_Family">Gojo Family</a>, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. <br> 
            He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.
        </p>
        <br>
    <h2>Abilities and Powers</h2>
    <b>Overall Skill Level:</b>
    <p> Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series, holding both immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique. <br>No one can seemingly match his skill level in the current storyline, except for the King of Curses, <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Sukuna">Sukuna</a>.</p>
    <b>Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant</b>
    <p>Satoru, in addition to his overwhelming levels of cursed energy, is also an extremely formidable martial artist in close combat, with extraordinary physical prowess to back up his skills.</p>
    <b>Immense Strength</b>
    <p>Satoru has extraordinary physical strength to fight against powerful curses without a problem, easily causing severe injuries to <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Jogo">Jogo</a> with powerful punches and throwing him a considerable distance with a single kick during their fight. <br> He was also able to easily rip out Jogo's head and later on his arm with sheer physical force and even managed to casually rip out <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Hanami">Hanami</a>'s roots.</p>
